# SyncZones Demo

This is a demo project for an app called "SyncZones". 

## What is SyncZones?

SyncZones is an app that helps you to sync between all your goals, visions, duties, learning, work, and other things you want to do in your life. It is a tool that helps you to organize your life and to keep track of your progress.

## What is this demo project?

This demo project is a simple example of how the data model of SyncZones could look like. It starts with a lot of data and the user can looking for specific data, edit, add, delete and modify it. The data will be stored at the client side in the app memory, and will be lost when the app is closed.
