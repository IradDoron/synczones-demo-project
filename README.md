This is a demo project for an app called "SyncZones".

## What is this demo project?

This demo project is a simple example of how the data model of SyncZones could look like. It starts with a lot of data and the user can looking for specific data, edit, add, delete and modify it. The data will be stored at the client side in the app memory, and will be lost when the app is closed.
