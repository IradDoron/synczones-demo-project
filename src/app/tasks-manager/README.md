Each task is inside some environment. It could be a learning environment, relationship, work, etc.

To be precice, there are some task generators, which are responsible for generating tasks for some environment.

## What is a task?

A task is a simple thing that you need to do. A task is focused on one thing only. It is not a project, it is not a goal, it is not a dream. It is a simple thing that you need to do.
A task could have some steps.

Example for a task: "Buy a milk". You need to follow some procedure to buy a milk, and by that to complete the task.

But where the tasks come from? From the task generators.


## Task generators

The most simple task generator is the "singular task generator". It generates tasks that are not connected to anything. They are just simple tasks with no other context to continuation.

There are singular tasks. They are not connected to anything. Are you hungry? So create a singular task "Eat a pizza" for example.



Another generator is a "project task generator". It generates tasks that are connected to some project. For example, you have a project "Build a house". So you need to create some tasks for that project. For example, "Buy a bricks", "Buy a cement", "Buy a sand", etc. These tasks are connected to the project "Build a house". They are not singular tasks. They are connected to some project.

Another generator is a "goal task generator". It generates tasks that are connected to some goal. For example, you have a goal "Become a programmer". So you need to create some tasks for that goal. Choose learning materials, connect with other developers, find a mentor etc. These tasks are connected to the goal "Become a programmer". They are not singular tasks. They are connected to some goal.

Another generator is a "learning task generator". It generates tasks that are connected to some learning environment. It could be a book, course, private lessons etc. 

Another generator is a "relationship task generator". It generates tasks that are connected to some relationship. It could be a relationship with your wife, girlfriend, friend, etc. For example, you have a relationship with your wife. So you need to create some tasks for that relationship. For example, "Buy a flowers", "Buy a chocolate", "Buy a gift", etc. These tasks are connected to the relationship with your wife.

Another generator is a "work task generator". It generates tasks that are connected to some work. It could be a work in some company, or your own business. For example, you have a work in some company. So you need to create some tasks for that work. For example, "Write a code", "Write a documentation", "Write a tests", etc. These tasks are connected to the work in some company.

Another generator is a "routine task generator". It generates tasks that are connected to some routine. It could be a morning routine, evening routine, etc. For example, you have a morning routine. So you need to create some tasks for that routine. For example, "Wake up", "Drink a water", "Eat a breakfast", etc. These tasks are connected to the morning routine.
