# Goals Manager

Goals Manager is a comprehensive system designed for creating, monitoring, and updating personal goals. It facilitates goal-setting at various levels and dimensions, allowing users to define their vision, set long-term SMART goals, and establish short-term SMART goals.

Goals Manager empowers users to:
- Create a compelling vision that aligns with their aspirations.
- Establish long-term SMART goals that provide a structured approach to success.
- Set short-term SMART goals to make steady progress and celebrate achievements along the way.

With Goals Manager, users can effectively plan their personal development, track their achievements, and adapt their goals as they evolve over time.

## Vision

The highest level in Goals Manager is the vision. A vision sets the tone and provides a general direction for the goals. When you read your vision, it should inspire and motivate you, guiding you towards your desired future.

How to define a good vision:
- If you write down your vision and read it, it should make you smile and feel excited.
- Don't hold back. Reach for the stars. Your vision should be ambitious and inspiring.

## Long-term SMART Goals

The level below the vision consists of long-term SMART goals. These goals are spread over a minimum of one year and can extend up to a decade. Long-term SMART goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound, providing a clear roadmap for your progress and development over an extended period.

## Short-term SMART Goals

The next level in the hierarchy comprises short-term SMART goals. These goals cover the time frame of one year from the present and typically take anywhere from one week to one year to achieve. Short-term SMART goals are designed to complement and support your long-term goals, making them more manageable and attainable.
